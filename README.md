# C# Object-Oriented Programming Fundamentals

This repository contains both my code and my instructor's code for [Fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming](https://balta.io/cursos/fundamentos-orientacao-objetos) course. 
The main class is `OOP/Program.cs` and every OOP concept was described with examples there. 
Some OOP concepts were implemented in different files and can be found under the `OOP/src` directory. 

The original code developed during the course by the instructor can be found within `CourseSrc`

## Getting Started
Clone the project
```
git clone https://github.com/MarceloCFerraz/Csharp-OOP
```

### Installation
Make sure you have installed [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download). 
I have used the latest .NET 8.0 so I recommend using it to avoid issues. 
and despite my careful coding to ensure it works in at least the last LTS release, things can still go wrong.

### Usage
This project aims to explain and provide examples for the main OOP concepts, which you can explore within OOP/Program.cs. 
However, you can verify that everything functions correctly by following these steps:

Get into the directory
```
cd Csharp-OOP/OOP/
```

Run project
```
dotnet run
```
